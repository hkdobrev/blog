### My Blog

I am writing my blog posts in Markdwown and I am currently using Tumblr as a blogging platform.

I could easily switch to Jekyll, GitHub Pagess and Octopress, Svbtle or just convert to HTML files and deploy on a static hosting site.

---

I am using a [tumblr gem](https://github.com/mwunsch/tumblr) to publish and edit my posts via the Tumblr API.

---

Another aspect of that is I am open sourcing my blog posts. Anyone could see drafts or propose a pull request.
